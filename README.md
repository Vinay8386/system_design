## HLD Basic Terminology

Before diving into system design and architecture, it is important to understand some core High-Level Design (HLD) concepts. This section explains the foundational building blocks used while designing scalable, reliable, and distributed systems.

- **Scaling** – How systems grow to handle more users and traffic
- **Stateful vs Stateless Applications** – How application data/state is managed
- **Load Balancer** – Managing and distributing incoming requests efficiently
- **TCP & UDP** – Communication protocols and their use cases
- **DNS (Domain Name System)** – Mapping domain names to server IP addresses
- **CDN (Content Delivery Network)** – Serving content faster using geographically distributed servers
- **Single Point of Failure (SPOF)** – Components that can cause total system failure
- **Database Replication** – Copying data across multiple databases for availability
- **Database Scaling** – Techniques to handle large volumes of data and traffic
