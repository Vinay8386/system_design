Question: “Design a Notification Sender that can send Email, SMS, and Push notifications.”

========================================================================================================================
Steps to be followed in this:

Step 1: Start with Bad Design.
step 2: Use Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
step 3: Use Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
step 4: Use Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
step 5: Use Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
step 6: Use Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
========================================================================================================================
Step 1: Start with Bad Design.

    => NotificationService:
        -> Problems:
            Adding WhatsApp requires modifying this class → violates OCP
            Class handles all logic → violates SRP
            Type checking and branching → violates LSP
            One fat interface → violates ISP
            Depends on concrete logic → violates DIP

    => now let’s fix everything one by one.

step 2: Use Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

    Each class should have only one reason to change. We split logic into separate classes:

    => EmailNotificationSender:
    => SmsNotificationSender:
    => PushNotificationSender:

    Now NotificationService should no longer contain sending logic.
    ✔ Improvement: NotificationService only coordinates. Actual sending logic is isolated

step 3: Use Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

    System should be open for extension but closed for modification. We create a common interface:
    => Interface:
        NotificationSender
    => Implementations:
        EmailSender
        SmsSender
        PushSender

    Now the service NotificationService:
        NotificationServiceWithOCP

    Now if you want to extend for Whatsapp Notification, just create a class
        WhatsappSender

    No need to change NotificationService → OCP achieved!

step 4: Use Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

    Child classes must be usable in place of the parent without breaking the system.
    Since:
        NotificationSender sender = new EmailSender();
        sender.send("Hi");
    works exactly the same as:
        NotificationSender sender = new SmsSender();
        sender.send("Hi");

    All subclasses behave like NotificationSender. We satisfied LSP because:
        No method throws unexpected exceptions
        No method violates expectations
        No method changes method behavior signature

step 5: Use Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
    Don't force clients to depend on methods they don’t use.
    Let’s say push messages support: Title, Image and Action Button but sms can't support this.
    If we do like this:
        NotificationSender
    ❌ SMS cannot implement all methods → violates ISP
    ❌ Email cannot implement all methods

    Let's fix it by splitting:
        TextNotification
        RichNotification

    Now:
        SMS implements only TextNotification
        Email implements only TextNotification
        Push implements both (because it supports rich content)

step 6: Use Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
    High-level modules should depend on abstractions, not concrete classes.

    WRONG: NotificationServiceViolateDIP
    CORRECT: NotificationServiceNotViolateDIP

    Now:
        NotificationService depends only on interface NotificationSender
        Concrete classes plugged in from outside (DI/IOC)

    This enables:
        Testability
        Flexibility
        Clean architecture
========================================================================================================================
Final Design:

interface NotificationSender {
    void send(String message);
}

class EmailSender implements NotificationSender {
    public void send(String msg) { /* email logic */ }
}

class SmsSender implements NotificationSender {
    public void send(String msg) { /* sms logic */ }
}

class PushSender implements NotificationSender {
    public void send(String msg) { /* push logic */ }
}

class NotificationService {
    private final NotificationSender sender;

    NotificationService(NotificationSender sender) {
        this.sender = sender;
    }

    void send(String msg) {
        sender.send(msg);
    }
}
