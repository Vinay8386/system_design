=> Creational design patterns:
    -> Creational Design Patterns focus on how objects are created. They abstract the instantiation process and help make a system:
        -> Independent of how objects are created
        -> Independent of which concrete classes are used
        -> Easier to extend, test, and maintain
        -> They mainly solve problem related to :
            -> Tight coupling
            -> Complex object creation
            -> Object lifecycle management

    -> Types of Creational Design Patterns
        -> Factory Design Pattern
        -> Abstract Factory Pattern
        -> Singleton Pattern
        -> Builder Pattern
        -> Prototype Pattern

============================================================! Factory Design Pattern !===============================================================================

=> Factory Pattern is needed mainly to
    -> Remove object creation complexity
    -> Reduce tight coupling between client and concrete classes
    -> Centralize object creation logic
    -> Follow SOLID principles, especially:
        -> Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
        -> Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

=> When to Use Factory Pattern
    -> When you need one product
    -> When object creation varies based on input
    -> When client should not know concrete classes

============================================================! Abstract Factory Pattern !===============================================================================
=> Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

=> Why Abstract Factory is Needed
    -> Factory Pattern creates one object.
    -> But sometimes, systems need groups of related objects and in this case Abstract Factory is helpful.

=> When to Use Abstract Factory
   -> When objects must be used together
   -> When you want to switch entire product families
   -> When platform/environment matters

=> Abstract Factory solves “Which group of objects should I create?”

============================================================! Singleton Pattern !===============================================================================
=> Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global access point to it.

============================================================! Builder Pattern !===============================================================================
=> Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

============================================================! Prototype Pattern !===============================================================================
=> Create new objects by copying an existing object instead of creating from scratch.
