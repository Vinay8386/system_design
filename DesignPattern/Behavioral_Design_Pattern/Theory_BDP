=> Creational = How objects are created
   Structural = How objects are structured
   Behavioral = How objects behave & talk to each other

=> Behavioral Design Patterns focus on how object communicate, responsibilities are distributed and behaviour changes at runtime without tightly coupling the classes.
   This pattern helps in:
    -> Reducing tight coupling
    -> Making systems flexible and extensible
    -> Implementing open–closed principle
    -> Handling complex workflows and state transitions

=> MANGA interviews often test:
    -> How will you change behavior without modifying existing code?
    -> How will objects communicate without knowing each other directly?
    -> Answer for both the question is Behavioral design pattern.

    -> Strategy, Observer, Command, State, Chain of Responsibility, Template Method

=> Scenario: Online Food Ordering System
    -> We’ll apply different behavioral patterns to:
        -> Payment selection
        -> Order status updates
        -> Discount calculation
        -> Order processing pipeline
        -> UI / Notification changes
        -> Workflow transitions
