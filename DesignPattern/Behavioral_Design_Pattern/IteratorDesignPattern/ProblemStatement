The Objectville Diner and Objectville Pancake House have menus. Each menu has multiple menu items, and each restaurant has its way of organizing its menu:

The Objectville Pancake House menu is implemented as a list (e.g., ArrayList).
The Objectville Diner menu is implemented as a map or array.

Now, a new business requirement arises: "We want to print all the menus for both restaurants in a unified way, without knowing their internal structures."
