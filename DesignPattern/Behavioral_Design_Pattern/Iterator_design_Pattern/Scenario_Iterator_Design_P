=> Provide a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its internal representation.
   Collection stores data, Iterator knows how to traverse it.

=> Implementation Flow:
    -> Step 1: Iterator Interface (Iterator<T>)
    -> Step 2: Aggregate Interface (Menu)
    -> Step 3: Concrete Collection (FoodMenu)
    -> Step 4: Concrete Iterator (FoodMenuIterator)
    -> Step 5: Client Code
