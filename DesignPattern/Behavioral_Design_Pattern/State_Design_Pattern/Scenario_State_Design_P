=> Definition: In real applications, an object’s behavior changes based on its current state.

=> Scenario: Food Order State Management
    -> User Action: Place Order, Cancel Order, Deliver Order. Behaviour depends on current order state
    -> State Pattern – Implementation Flow
        -> Step 1: Create State Interface (OrderState). This is the common contract for all states.
            -> Defines all possible actions that depend on state
            -> Example methods: placeOrder(), cancelOrder(), deliverOrder()
        -> Create Concrete State Classes
            -> CreatedState, PlacedState, DeliveredState, CancelledState
            -> Each class implements OrderState
            -> Contains state-specific behavior
            -> Decides what actions are allowed or not
            -> Each state knows how to behave.
        -> Create Context Class (Order)
            -> Holds a reference to the current state
            -> Delegates action calls to the current state
            -> Allows state transitions using setState()
            -> Context is the main object whose behavior changes.
        -> Handle State Transitions
            -> Concrete state decides: What the next state should be
            -> When to change the state
            -> State transition happens via the context
            -> State controls the flow, not the client.
        -> Client Code
            -> Client creates the Order and call action like placeOrder() or cancelOrder()
