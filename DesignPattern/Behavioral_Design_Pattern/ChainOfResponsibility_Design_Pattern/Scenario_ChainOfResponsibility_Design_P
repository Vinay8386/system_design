=> Pass the request along a chain of handlers until one of them handles it. Each Handlers:
    -> Decide whether it can handle the request.
    -> Otherwise passes it to the next handlers.

=> Scenario: Order Approval System. Order amount approval:
    -> 1,000 → Manager
    -> 5,000 → Director
    -> Above 5,000 → CEO

=> Implementation Flow:
    -> Step 1: Handler Interface (OrderApprover)
        -> Declare method to set next handler and handle request
    -> Step 2: Abstract Handler (Optional but Recommended): AbstractApprover
        -> Stores reference to next handler
        -> Avoids code duplication
    -> Step 3: Concrete Handlers: Manager, Director, CEO
    -> Step 4: Client Code (Chain Setup)
