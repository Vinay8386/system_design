=> This is also explained in Creational Design Pattern in Notification system example but it is a type of Structural Design Pattern.

=> Problem in Our Food Delivery Scenario: Checking delivery status is an expensive operation requires calling external delivery system but we want Authentication check, Logging, Lazy initialization.
    -> Without Proxy:
        DeliveryService deliveryService = new RealDeliveryService();
        deliveryService.trackOrder("ORD123");
    -> Problem: No security, always hit real service and no control layer.

=> Applying Proxy Pattern (Step by Step)
    -> Step 1️⃣ Common Interface (Subject): DeliveryService
    -> Step 2️⃣ Real Subject (Actual Implementation): RealDeliveryService
    -> Step 3️⃣ Proxy Class (Core of Pattern): DeliveryServiceProxy
    -> Client Code (Very Important): OrderClient

=> Detailed notes about proxy design pattern is mentioned inside Creational_Design_Pattern package.
