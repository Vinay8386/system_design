=> Definition: It is a way to combine or arrange different classes and objects to form a complex or bigger structure to solve a particular requirements.

=> They help answer questions like:
    -> How do I connect objects without making the system rigid?
    -> How do I extend behaviour without modifying existing code?
    -> How do I hide complexity from the client?

=> Key Goals:
    -> Reduce tight coupling
    -> Promote composition over inheritance
    -> Make system easier to scale and modify

=> Types of Structural Design Pattern:
    -> Decorator Design Pattern
    -> Facade Design Pattern
    -> Adapter Design Pattern
    -> Proxy Design Pattern
    -> Composite Design Pattern
    -> Bridge Design Pattern
    -> Flyweight Design Pattern

=> Scenario: Online Food Delivery System (like Swiggy / Zomato)
    -> Initial requirements:
        -> User places a food order
        -> System calculates price
        -> Optional add-ons (extra cheese, toppings, packaging)
        -> Payment processing
        -> Delivery tracking
        -> Notifications
    -> Initial Thought Process (Beginner / No Pattern)
        -> One big class
        -> Too many if-else
        -> Tight coupling
        -> Hard to extend

    -> Code WITHOUT Any Design Pattern (Problematic Design)
        -> FoodOrderServiceProblematicImplementation: This code
            -> Violates Open–Closed Principle
            -> Adding a new food item → modify existing code
            -> Adding a new add-on → more if-else
            -> Hard to test
            -> Hard to extend
            -> God class problem

    -> Use structural design pattern to evolve this issue:
        -> Adapter: Integrating third party payment gateway
        -> Decorator: Adding toppings, add-on dynamically
        -> Facade: Simplifying order placements for client
        -> Proxy: Delivery tracking, security and caching
        -> Composite: Combo meals(meals = multiple item)
        -> Bridge: Separating payment method for order
        -> Flyweight: Reusing common food item objects
