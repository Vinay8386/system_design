==============================================================================! Four Main Principal !==============================================================================================
In System design, there are four main principal: KISS means keeping solutions simple. DRY means eliminating duplication. SOLID are five foundational OO design principles. 
YAGNI means don’t build features until they are needed. Together they help write clean, maintainable, scalable software without over-engineering.

1. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Prefer the simplest working solution. Avoid unnecessary complexity, abstractions, or over-engineering.
  -> Why:
    -> More readable + Easier to maintain + Fewer bugs
    -> Example: Using Factory + Strategy + Observer to print a message. (❌ Overkill)
                Simple (KISS): System.out.println("Hello");

2. DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself): Do not duplicate logic. Keep a single source of truth.
  -> Why: 
    -> Consistency
    -> Less bug-prone    
    -> Easier updates
  -> Example
    -> ❌ Tax calculation duplicated everywhere
        price * 1.18;
        foodCost * 1.18;
        bill * 1.18;
    -> ✔ DRY
        double applyTax(double amount) { return amount * 1.18; }

3. SOLID (Structure OO code properly - Clean, readable code)
4. YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It)
  -> Don’t build features until they are actually needed.
  -> Avoid adding flexibility, configurations, or modules “just in case.”
  -> Why: 
    -> Prevents over-engineering
    -> Saves time
    -> Reduces unnecessary code
    -> Keeps complexity low
  -> Example
    -> ❌ Adding 12 payment methods at the start even though only UPI is needed.
    -> ✔ YAGNI : Implement only UPI now → add others later if required.
