=> Inheritance vs Composition
    -> Inheritance(Identity): Inheritance means one class derives another class and inherits its behavior and properties.
        -> It represents an “IS-A” relationship
        -> Example: Car is a Vehicle, Dog is an Animal
            class Vehicle {
                void move() {
                    System.out.println("Vehicle is moving");
                }
            }

            class Car extends Vehicle {
            }
        -> Here Car is a vehicle so Car automatically gets move()
    -> Composition(Capability): Composition means one class contains another class as a field and uses its behavior.
        -> It represents a “HAS-A” relationship
        -> Example: Car has an Engine, House has a room
            class Engine {
                void start() {
                    System.out.println("Engine started");
                }
            }

            class Car {
                private Engine engine = new Engine();

                void startCar() {
                    engine.start();
                }
            }
        -> Here Car HAS-A Engine. Car delegates work to Engine.

=> How to identify the relationship:
    -> IS-A  -----------> One object is a type of another -----------> Inheritance
    -> HAS-A ----------->     One object uses another     -----------> Composition
